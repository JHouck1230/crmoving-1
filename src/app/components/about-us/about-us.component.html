        <p class="px-5 lead text-justify">We began simply by moving family and friends to new apartments and homes locally. We have since grown to serve the greater North Central West Virginia area; now operating as a licensed and insured moving company equipped to handle local moves of any size. While our clientele may have changed and expanded, our mission to treat each customer as if we are moving our own friends and family has remained the same.</p>
